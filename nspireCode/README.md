## Background
This goal of this project is to build a proof of concept of using a language model on a small device, suh as the TiNspire. Currently, we have embedded a perceptron which predicts between the letters 'a' and 'b'. Users are able to interact with the application through the use of their cursor, and buttons as described below

## Required To use application
Ndless 3.6

## To contribute
Ndless SDK

## How to use
p: predict
c: clear screen
spacebar: turns cursor red (pen up), or turns cursor green (pen down)
mouse: move to draw letter
